## Pipeline function

- The pipeline function returns an end-to-end object that performs an NLP task on one or several texts.
- GPT, BERT, T5 are few transformer models, trained as language models, This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion







Key words
- language models
- self supervised learning - Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data
- transfer learning or fine tuning -  models trained on self supervised learning are not very useful for specific practical tasks. The general pretrained model then goes through a process called transfer learning or fine-tuning. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a given task
